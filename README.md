Fourth Project

Node.js and Angular.js Website

Hometown

The Idea:

- Everybody has a hometown or somewhere they know really well or call home.
- No-one knows your hometown like you do. 
- Of course there are already many websites out there, including large well-known ones, that probably tell you alot about your hometown, and alot that it has to offer.
- But you can't beat local knowledge, so this is why I came up with the idea of 'HomeTown'. A site where you can share all those little local gems that only you and other locals know about. Places that are 'off the beaten track' and little known to tourists.
- But of course, you can also share those popular ones as well. It's all about sharing your local knowledge with others.
- Then, when you are planning on visiting a new location, or even somewhere you have visited before and think you know pretty well, you can come to HomeTown and checkout that location and what it has to offer and see the recommendations that people have added.
