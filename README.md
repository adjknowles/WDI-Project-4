Fourth Project

Node.js and Angular.js Website

Hometown


The Idea:

- Everybody has a hometown or somewhere they know really well or call home.
- No-one knows your hometown like you do. 
- Of course there are already many websites out there, including large well-known ones, that probably tell you alot about your hometown, and alot that it has to offer.
- But you can't beat local knowledge, so this is why I came up with the idea of 'HomeTown'. A site where you can share all those little local gems that only you and other locals know about. Places that are 'off the beaten track' and little known to tourists.
- But of course, you can also share those popular ones as well. It's all about sharing your local knowledge with others.
- Then, when you are planning on visiting a new location, or even somewhere you have visited before and think you know pretty well, you can come to HomeTown and checkout that location and what it has to offer and see the recommendations that people have added.


Technologies used:

In this project I have used the following technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- JQuery
- Node.js
- Angular.js
- Google Maps/Places
- Bootstrap
- MongoDB
- Express
- Animate CSS


Approach taken:

- Brainstormed some possible ideas
- Made a plan using the chosen idea
- Created a Trello board outlining what needed to be done, and depending on their importance, the order in which they needed to be executed.
- Produced an ERD diagram, mapping out the models and their relationships with one another.
- Created wireframes using Balsamiq, displaying how I imagined the website and its various pages to look.
- I then moved into the development phase and created the back-end API.
- I ran some tests in the mongo database and Insomnia.
- Once this was all working as expected, I moved onto the front-end.
- I downloaded Bootstrap as my front-end CSS framework, and created some basic HTML structure and CSS styling.
_ I then focused on implementing the Google Maps/Places API within my site.
- After this I tested the connection between the API (back-end) and front-end, making sure I could pull out the data from the database.
- Then I moved on to creating the partial view pages.
- I then went back to the styling - working my way through the different pages to get them looking as I had imagined.


Challenges:

- One of the main challenges I had was implementing the Google Maps/Places API. This took up more of my time than I had expected. Implementing it within the recommendations controller was also a change from the last project.
- I chose to use Bootstrap for my front-end css framework, one that I haven't used in any depth before. This definitely had its PROS and CONS. Some parts were easy to work with, making changes relatively easy. However, other parts of it were incredibly hard to override or change.












If I had more time:

There are a number of features I would have liked to have added or take further:

- Added Facebook and Twitter authentication.
- Added extra search features - for example, by Post Code - allowing you to find recommendations in a more specific location.
- Having a current location feature - to show you any recommendations near you.
- Added a photo uploader so that the users can upload their own image.
- Add ratings and reviews to the recommendations. Each user can add their own.
- Add additional cities.
- Add additional information to the recommendation pages - provide extra knowledge for users of the site.
- Refacter the code - make it dryer.
- As always - go Global - HomeTowns are everywhere!
